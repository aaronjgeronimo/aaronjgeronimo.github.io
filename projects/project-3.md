summary: My first game.
---

As a final project for ICS 111, we were tasked with creating a game using Elcipse to write a java program. We were grouped in three's, which unfortunately turned into a pair for me and my partner as our third member seldom showed up to class. 

ICS 111 was the first programming class that my partner or I had taken, and both of us having no previous experience with coding prior to taking the class, this was quite the endevour. 

We split the work, one working on the gameboard and functions, while the other worked on the algorithms to determine a winner. I was tasked with the game board and functions. We set a goal that the the users would be able to play through the game and win by a horizontal, vertical, or be a tie if the game board fills before then. Being able to write the correct algorithm to win with a diagonal connect four was an bonus goal if we had time. 

By the time the project was due, we were successful in our goals. The game would start and users were able to win by a vertical and horizontal connect four. The game also called a tie once the gameboard was filled. However, we did not finish the algorithm to determine a win via horizontal connect 4. We recieved an aA for the project regardles. 

In this project, i learned to work well with a partner and cooperate remotely while coding in different places. I also learned time management and how to prioritize goals in order to finish on time.
