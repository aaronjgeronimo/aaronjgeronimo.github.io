# Why Studbudd?

This project was the final project for ICS 314, from a list of possible projects to undertake. Groups were formed by prefference of who to work with and what project was preffered by the group members. Four other students and myself were assigned "Study Buddy", which for our project was renamed Studbudd.

## The Objective

The objective of Studbudd is to provide users with an intuitive and visually appealing interface to find either a mentor to help you study, or as a mentor, a student in need of mentoring.

## How the objective was accomplished

On the Studbudd homepage, visitors are greeted with instructions on how to use the app and a list of the top three mentors. In the navbar, visitors can have a look at a list of classes. Clicking a listed class will display mentors that are proficient in that field of study. In the top right, visitors can sign up for an account in which they will be granted access to more features. Once signed in, users now have access to a listing of other students and a listing of availabilities. In the student listing, the user can click to view other profiles and plan group study sessions with others who need help in the same subject and have similar avalibilities.  Users are also able to apply to be a mentor, to offer help in subjects that they are proficient in while being able to still recieve help in subjects they are not. Users who are granted an admin role have hte ability to edit and/or delete mentor and student profiles if need be. 

## What I took away from this project

This was easily one of the more intense group projects that I have worked on. The goal for the final project was to have students utilize all the new knowledge of coding acquired over the course of the semester and put them all into one project and have the project driven by issue-based management.
