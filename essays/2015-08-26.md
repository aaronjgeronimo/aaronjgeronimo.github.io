## my own interests

Ever since I was little, I’ve had a fascination with mechanics and how things were assembled. As soon as I had enough dexterity in my hands to utilize a screwdriver, and accumulated enough knowledge that I knew that a screw held something together. I would attempt to take anything apart so long as no one stopped me. As time progressed, this fascination turned into a borderline obsession. Watching my uncle repair our family sedan solidified my aspirations to work on cars as a profession. RC cars turned into skateboards, skateboards turned into bicycles, bicycles turned into cars. I was fortunate enough that my dad passed on his 2007 Mustang to me as a graduation present. This opened the floodgates of possibilities and I started to modify and change anything and everything that I could within my realm of skill. 

This had a heavy influence on my after-high school plans. I knew that whatever I ended up doing as a profession, it had to have something to do with a car. I entered college in the fall of 2014 with every intention of graduating with a B.S. in mechanical engineering. I was excited to for the years to come, but after two years in Mechanical Engineering, it dawned on me that this major is not for me. After a long discussion with my academic advisor and my family, I switched my major to Information and Computer Sciences in the summer of 2017. This left me in a dilemma, it was a last minute change and I no longer knew what I was going to do with this new degree. 

## what does this have to do with ICS, let alone Software Engineering?

My first semester in ICS was eye opening. I figured out how I was going to use this degree and still work on cars. This is where my interest in Software Engineering and Cars collide. Most if not all modern car engines are managed by a fairly sophisticated engine control unit. A computer that takes in the inputs of the various sensors in the engine compartment to actively adapt the fuel mapping and engine tuning to better suit the conditions at hand. With companies such as Holley, AEM electronics and Haltech producing and developing standalone engine control units that can be added to older engines to give them the same capabilities as modern engines. Holley’s standalone implements a self-learn electronic fuel injection system that surpasses the capabilities of stock ECU’s. I knew that this is the niche that both my passion for cars and Information and Computer Sciences.  

I hope that software engineering can help develop my skills to help me either design and develop self-learning EFI systems for a company, or if possible, design and start my own. I hope to gain experience with adaptive software and Artificial Intelligence, to improve the capabilities of ECU’s to also aid in driver assistance such as assistive steering and braking, and possibly autonomy.
