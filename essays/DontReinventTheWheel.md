But at its core, its still round with a hole in the middle, just like the first wheel. 

## "Reinventing" the wheel
So if modern wheels still have the same basic characteristics, is the modern day counterpart the wheel reinvented? I would argue no, it was improved on greatly, but not reinvented. Why waste time completely reinventing a design that has already been proven? More can be accomplished by taking a proven design and improving on it. For example, lets say 4 individuals were tasked with stacking boxes, and the tallest box tower would win. Each person is given 5 boxes. EAch person could easily stack 5 boxes. But they would end up with 4 towers, all 5 boxes tall.
