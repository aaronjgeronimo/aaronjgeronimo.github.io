## The wheel as we know it
It is believed that the first wheel ever created by man was a rounded stone with a hole in the approximate middle for an axle to pass through. Fast forward to today, wheels for cars are now made of metal alloys instead of stone, and its edges are wrapped in rubber and air for more grip and comfort. But at its core, its still round with a hole in the middle, just like the first wheel. 

## "Reinventing" the wheel
So if modern wheels still have the same basic characteristics, is the modern day counterpart the wheel reinvented? I would argue no, it was improved on greatly, but not reinvented. Why waste time completely reinventing a design that has already been proven? More can be accomplished by taking a proven design and improving on it. For example, lets say 4 individuals were tasked with stacking boxes, and the tallest box tower would win. Each person is given 5 boxes. Each person could easily stack 5 boxes. But they would end up with 4 towers, all 5 boxes tall. If they had instead stacked 5 boxes, then another person stacked 5 boxes on top of the first, and so on, they could have ended up with 1 tower, 25 boxes tall. Being able to take what was already done and use it as a base, makes achieving a higher goal easier. 

## The Coding Wheel
Just like the wheel, being able to use someone else's code and use it as the base for new code, so you don't have to "reinvent the wheel" makes developing a new app better and faster. This base for which we can build new code from is called a design pattern. A particular example of using a design pattern that i'm very familiar with is building webpages using code written with Semantic UI, to build webpages with react and meteor. This semster we were tasked with building the lucky belly website using semantic UI, react and meteor. Having first built the website using semantic, made building with react much easier. The semantic code acts as the design pattern for react, and the react code is then used as the design pattern for meteor. 

## Don't Reinvent the wheel
Don't reinvent the wheel if its not necessary. There is no shame is using pre-existing code as a base for your code, so long as the proper credit is given. In the long run, it will be better for you since the time that would have been spent building from the ground up, can instead be put toward building floors 3 and 4 since you started with a building with floors 1 and 2 already built!
