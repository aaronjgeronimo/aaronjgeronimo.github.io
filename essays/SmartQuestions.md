The internet has no lack of resources when you come across a problem. Forums are a great place to ask questions and recieve answers from a variety of people of varying profession and skill level.

He then goes on to ask why this is. The answer chosen as correct in this thread is also an indicator that the question was asked in a smart way. The answer is clear and precise. Since there was no vagueness in the question, the poster of the question was able to fully understand what was being asked and give a full explination.
