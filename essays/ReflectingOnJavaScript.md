## Don't knock it till' you've tried it

Before the beginning of this semester, the only programming languages I knew were Java and a little C/C++, with Java being my personal preference. Having never written any code in JavaScript before, the first assignment seemed daunting to me. But after a few lines of code, it seemed very reminiscent of Java. Having majority of my programming language experience in Java, writing JavaScript for the first time was a very easy transition between the two programming languages. Similar, with different syntax, but easy enough to get used to very quickly.

Between JavaScript, Java, and C/C++, they are all very similar in terms of difficulty to learn. However, what makes Java and JavaScript standout more to me, is that their editing platforms are far easier to use. With C/C++ requiring the use of SSH secure shell and having to navigate with prompts. Both Java and JavaScript have easier-to-use interfaces such as Eclipse and JSFiddle that make coding far easier. Eclipse and JSFiddle both point out errors in the code while the user writes it. Whereas with C/C++ and secure shell, the errors don’t show until the user compiles the code and if an error is found, a compile error is returned. So far, I like JavaScript as much as I liked Java, with still a slight preference toward Java since it is still the language I have the most experience in. 

## When you've knocked it, and still hate it. Try it in a different way 

Learning isn’t quite black and white. Learning one thing a particular way, may not work with a different thing, or even with a different person. Sometimes lectures and reading a textbook are better. In other situations, practice is the better option. Just like a spoken language, learning a programming language requires a lot of practice and effort. While taking Spanish in high school, and taking a 200 level Ilocano class this semester, It helped more to speak and practice, than read a textbook and remember. Athletic Software Engineering is more like the speak and practice approach to teaching. The focus is on the students practicing and reading on their own, instead of trying to learn and reduplicate what is taught in a lecture. 

In athletic software engineering, more effort is definitely required, which induces more stress. However, I feel that it is far more enjoyable. The ability to read and practice at your own pace, and be challenged by timed WOD’s during class keeps you on your feet and puts you under pressure to perform well. In my case, not the kind of pressure that makes you want to give up, but rather makes you want to try harder.
