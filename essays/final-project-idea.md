## Overview:

Problem: There are many problematic facilities(i.e bathrooms, classrooms, etc) on UH Manoa. Even though we are given a hot line to call to report problems, no one uses it. 

Solution: Design an app that makes it easier for users to report problems, and easier for admins to organize and prioritize which ones to solve first. 

## Mock up page ideas:
- Landing page *live news feed on landing page*
- User report page
- User map page
- User "what you can do to help" page
- Admin home page
- Admin map page
- Admin problem list page

## Case Ideas:
- User opens landing page, opens report page, reports a problem and pins where problem is on map page. 
- Admin opens landing, logs in via admin login link, views list of reported problems, can mark completed/important/fix asap, view number of reports on map. 

## Beyond the basics:
- Improves UH Manoa
- Less downtime for facilities
- Gets students more involved
